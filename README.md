INSOLVENCY means in simpler terms also known as BANKRUPTCY .

To assess loan eligibility, banks and other financial lending institutions often look at a loan applicant's credit history, economic status, and other factors, but the relationship between these factors is usually not well-defined and is most likely heuristic in nature.It is very common for the company's present position, such as its rise or fall in the recent past, to be taken into account when determining its financial stability. This could lead to misleading assumptions about the company's chances of defaulting on a loan.We can create a model that is not only more accurate but also more cost-effective in solving this problem using effective classification and time series analyses.In order to achieve this goal, we will evaluate the data, supplement it with data from other sets, and try to understand the static variables that most strongly correlate with a company's financial status by developing a classification strategy and evaluating the model's measures.
